### Wall of Coins Platform API

To receive sales affiliate commissions, you must have a Publisher account with Wall of Coins. Visit this page for more information: https://wallofcoins.com/developer-api

API endpoints:

* Production: https://wallofcoins.com/api/v1
* Development: https://woc.reference.genitrust.com/api/v1

### **Authentication methods**

WOC API supports authentication via auth token.

#### **Auth token:**

In order to be authenticated you should send a token within every API request. Token must be sent in request header called **‘X-Coins-Api-Token’**. Token must not be expired. Token must have a valid signature and all needed authentication data. Token will look like a long **base64** encoded string: **YXV0aDo2OjE0MjE1OTU1ODN8MDk3NTAyYmE1YzM4YWY4MzUxYTg1NDU2ODFjN2U4ODgyZDhkYmY0Yg==** Each token has a limited lifetime (currently 3 hours, but it can be changed). Token expiration time is always returned by API. Your application should care about automatical token renewal before it expires.

"multipleBanks": [],
"isExtendedSearch": false,
"incremented": true
}
```

When they Discovery Input offers object contains...

```
{
. . .
incremented: true
}
```

This means that the search amount (for example "$25") was not available for all offers--some offers that are available REQUIRE the end user (buyer) to deposit slightly more than $25. This is what is meant by the term ```incremented``` so buyer need to pay that incremented amount for buy dash.
singleDeposit - gets offers directly from seller's Ads
doubleDeposit - combine Ads from the same bankBusiness to fill amount of needed coins
multipleBanks - combine Ads from different banks
isExtendedSearch - True if there is no enough coins for buyers amount of cash and we try to look for Ads that can supply at least half of needed coins.
and we try ExtendedSearch only if there is no bankBusiness in DI and buyer provide location.

We display singleDeposit at first and then doubleDeposit and multipleBanks

#### CREATE HOLD

##### (NEW USER REGISTER USING PHONE NUMBER)
From offer list on offer click we have to create an hold on offer for generate initial request.

```http
HEADER:
X-Coins-Publisher: ##
Content-Type: application/json

POST https://woc.reference.genitrust.com/api/v1/holds/
```

It need  X-Coins-Publisher as a header parameter.

##### Request :

```json
{
"publisherId": "",
"offer": "eyJ1c2QiOiAiNTA...",
"phone": "+19411101467",
"deviceName": "Ref Client",
"deviceCode": "device-code-is-a-password_and_MUST_be_30_characters_or_more"
}
```

##### (Existing user request for create hold)

```http
HEADER:
X-Coins-Api-Token: ZGV2aWNlOjQ0NT...
X-Coins-Publisher: ##
Content-Type: application/json

POST https://woc.reference.genitrust.com/api/v1/holds/
```

It need X-Coins-Publisher and X-Coins-Api-Token as a header parameter.

##### Request :

```json
{
"publisherId": "",
"offer": "eyJ1c2QiOiAiNTA...",
"phone": "+19411101467",
"deviceName": "Ref Client",
"deviceCode": "device-code-is-a-password_and_MUST_be_30_characters_or_more"
}
```


##### Response :

```json
{
"id": "999fd1b03f78309988a64701cfaaae37",
"expirationTime": "2017-08-21T10:08:40.592Z",
"discoveryInput": "1260e3afa4f03a195ac1e73c965c797",
"holds": [{
"amount": "53.65853659",
"currentPrice": "9.43",
"status": ""
}],
"token": "ZGV2aWNlOjQ0N...",
"tokenExpiresAt": "2017-08-21T13:05:40.535Z",
"__PURCHASE_CODE": "CK99K"
}
```


##### Status Code :

* 201 returned when the hold is created
* 400 returned when one of the parameters are missing! for example, if you're creating a new device... you need "phone", "deviceName", and "deviceCode".
* 401 will be "returned when a X-Coins-Api-Token is required or the phone number supplied needs password".
* 403 will have details: "Not permitted to create a hold while an open hold or order with status WD is current."
* 404 returned when the offer no-longer is available (either the time expired or the ad will now be negative.)

if you get status code 403, then you have to delete active hold first then need to create hold again. As you have **auth token** available, you need to call Get Hold API by passing **auth token** as **X-Coins-Api-Token** in header, which will return active hold in response. Get Hold API returns array of hold in response, then user need to delete active hold with status is equal to “AC” by calling Delete Hold API by passing **auth token** as **X-Coins-Api-Token** in header. Suppose user do not get any active holds then it means that there is some pending order. so you need to get all orders and find pending order with status = "WD" and give option to confirm deposite Or cancel Order functionality.
##### Hold Status :

PE = Pending
AC = Active, waiting for Order
CAP = Captured
EX = Expired
CAN = Canceled

This API will send purchase code to user's device on his register phone number and it will be same
as `__PURCHASE_CODE` value.

#### GET HOLD

**GET /api/v1/holds/**

This endpoint will return active **holdId**. You must need to pass **auth token** as **X-Coins-Api-Token** in header of this API.
